/*
* we will write a function that evaluates simple arithmetic expressions like
* (1 + 2) + 4
*
* our example will only include one type of operation: sum of two numbers
*
* we store the expression in a tree-like structure where each node is either
* a sum(Sum) or a number (Num)
* Num - a leaf node
* Sum - node has two children
