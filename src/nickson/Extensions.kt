/* Kotlin provides the ability to extend a class with new functionality without having to inherit from the class or use
 * design patterns such as Decorator.
 *
 * You can write new functions for a class from a third-party lib that you can't modify.
 * Such functions are available for calling in the usual way as if they were methods of the original class.
 * Known as 'extension functions'
